Things we want to do:
- Make separate sections for delibs, elections, bylaws
- Adding/editing candidates should be admin-only
	also clean it the fuck up
- get rid of "advance voting"
- ASK FOR CONFIRMATION AFTER WIPE VOTES
- generally make it less ugly/bootstrappy (add OT colors?)
- test out the voting page w/ lots of pics and see what sucks

Things we have to do:
- thin out the controllers (separation of concerns)
- make sure routes are "proper" (whatever that means)
- add some specs
	minimum one feature spec and one model spec
