This app is a voting system for our fraternity. We use it to vote on people who wish to join our elite ranks. You have to log in with Facebook, and we have the default setting as automatic admin access so the graders can see all of the admin features. If you would like to make yourself NOT an admin, you can do so on the USERS page. We also have a proxy system for losers without Facebook, which allows limited access to the necessary features. 

On the Voting page, you can see the pictures of the candiates and vote. The options are yes, no, or abstain. 

If you are an admin, you can also access the candidates, the tally, and the users.

On the candidates page, you can add names and pictures of candidates to vote on.

On the tally page, you can see the votes. Candidates with enough votes to get in will be highlighted in green, and those with too many no votes to get in will be highlighted in red.

On the users page, you can grant or remove admin access from people.

This app probably makes more sense to people who understand the voting rules of Theta Tau Professional Engineering Fraternity, but we hope it makes some degree of sense to you. Thanks for reading.
